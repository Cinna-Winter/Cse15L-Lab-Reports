The absolute path before entering command?: `/c/Users/Cindy/OneDrive/CSE 15L` 

Why did I get this output?: When using `cd`, or the change directory command, without any arguments, it will be automated to move to the variable considered as **Home** if it does exist in the system. In this case: `/c/Users/Cindy` is its home directory.
